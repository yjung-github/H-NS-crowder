0. There are three files in this GitHub repository.
  - data.chain, in.chain, and manual.txt

1. "data.chain" which is an example of a data file 
  - # of monomers = 200
  - # of H-NS = 30
  - # of crowders = 2477 (which is equivalent to the volume fraction of crowders = 0.08)

2. "in.chain" which is an input script

3. With LAMMPS installed, you can run the LAMMPS command in the directory where your input script and data file are located.
  - lmp_serial -in in.file -var in_filename data.chain
